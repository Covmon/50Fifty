Our Methodology: How 50Fifty's Predictions Work

October 30, 2018

We've worked on 50Fifty over the past few months, and now that it's released, we want to share details of how we collected data for our model and what factors impact our predictions.

<h1>Overview</h1>

Unlike other prediction models, which rely primarily on current polls and then add in other data, 50Fifty's model weighs a number of data points in each other's context. It does so using supervised machine learning, a type of AI that finds patterns and relationships between different attributes, called "features," of (in our case) political races, and uses those relationships and known features to predict vote outcomes. We do not assign weights to each feature; rather, the model learns which features are most meaningful and what exactly they signify.

The features used in our model include: historical election results, generic ballot polling, demographic data, fundraising, election-specific polling, incumbency, primary competition, and candidate experience. These features are elaborated on below. 

The same model is behind 50Fifty's predictions for Governors, the U.S. Congress, and state legislatures. We found that crossing-referencing results and data from different types of races reduced, rather than increased, our margin of error.

Our model is trained using tens of thousands of past elections going back to 2000. In its training datasets, the model had an average margin of error of just 4%. Our election results data is derived from <a href="http://openelections.net">OpenElections</a>, an organization whose goal is "to create the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States." 

<h1>Features and Data</h1>

<b>Historical election results:</b> The principle behind this data point is simple: the party-line results of a particular district will likely be similar to its results in previous elections. Generally, and adjusted for the overall political climate (which the model accomplishes by factoring in generic ballot), districts vote fairly consistently election to election. That's why this data is what the model has decided to weigh the most.

<b>Generic ballot:</b> Today's political climate is obviously very different than the climate during past midterm and presidential election cycles. The model accounts for these countrywide trends, both this year and in past elections, using generic ballot polls, which ask voters, all else aside, which party they would vote for to represent them in Congress. Currently, the average generic ballot puts the Democratic Party ahead nationally by between 7 and 9 points.

<b>Demographics:</b> Demographics can predict a lot about how a district will vote, but often, these patterns only emerge when synthesized with other data points. Our model uses U.S. Census data, including age, race, and socioeconomic status.

<b>Fundraising:</b> Fundraising data has a few implications. First, the <i>amount</i> of money raised determines how much a campaign has available to spend on advertising and other expenses, as well as how well-backed a candidate is by powerful industries and interest groups. Second, the <i>number</i> of donations received by a candidate may indicate how popular, well-known, or charismatic he or she is. Fundraising data is from the National Institute on Money in Politics' fantastic website <a target="_blank" href="https://followthemoney.org">FollowTheMoney</a>.

<b>Polling Data:</b> This feature is very straightforward. The model factors in the latest polling data in races for which it is available (polls are generally only available in U.S. Congress and Governors races). This allows the model to make race-specific adjustments based on factors that can't be measured by other features.

<b>Incumbency:</b> An incumbent is the candidate in a race who was previously elected. If there is an incumbent, that candidate gains some advantage over a challenger, even if the district's demographics and other factors favor the challenger's party. Our predictions indicate the incumbent of a race with a lowercase, italicized <i>i</i> next to a candidate's name.

<b>Other Factors:</b> We use a few other minor features, like whether a candidate faced an opponent in the primary election, and the experience of both candidates (as measured by number of terms served in elected office). However, the features above carry the majority of the weight in our predictions. It's incredible what machine learning can accomplish even in a system as complex as U.S. politics and with only a few data points.
